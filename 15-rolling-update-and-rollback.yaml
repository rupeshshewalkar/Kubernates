##Rolling update: Gradually rolling out a change to a set of replica pods to avoid downtime
#This is how you can perform a rolling update using a deployment:

 kubectl set image deployment/<deployment name> <container name>=<image name> --record
 
#This sets the image for the deployment to the value specified for <image name>.
#--record records the changes made during the rolling update. This data can be used later# to roll back the change


#Rollback: Reverting to a previous state after an update Get a list of previous rolling updates like so:
   kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment name>
#Use the --revision flag to get more information on a specific revision: 
  kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment name> --revision=<revision number>
#You can rollback to the state before last revision with kubectl rollout undo:
  kubectl rollout undo deployment.v1.apps/<deployment name>
#Or use the --to-revision flag to roll back to a specific earlier revision:
  kubectl rollout undo deployment.v1.apps/<deployment name> --to-revision=<revision number>
